# Responsive Pong

This responsive pong is my first Javascript project. I made it for another project: [ft_transcendence](https://github.com/Lurik13/ft_transcendence), which is an entire [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) website where you can play pong. I also created an AI for this game.

But this javascript version is an older version where I hadn't yet done AI and where the graphics were much less stunning.


## How to play

First, to download the game, enter `git@github.com:Lurik13/Responsive-Pong.git` on your terminal.
Then open the `pong.html` page.
This is a **local multiplayer** game. The left-hand paddle is played with the `'W'` and `'S'` keys, while the right-hand paddle is played with the `'I'` and `'K'` keys.
There are no score or time limits.


## How to change the dimensions

You can find the ``dimensions`` variable on the _11th line_ of the `pong.js` file.
You can try with 16/9, 4/3, 9/16, 16/3, etc ...
> I'm aware that there are collision bugs for certain narrow and unplayable dimensions like 1/16.
